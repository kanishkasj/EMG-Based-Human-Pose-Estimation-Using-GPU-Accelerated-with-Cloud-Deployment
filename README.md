# EMG-Based-Human-Pose-Estimation-Using-GPU-Accelerated-with-Cloud-Deployment
 This project implements a real-time EMG-based human pose estimation system.   Traditional camera based pose estimation struggles in low-light and privacy-sensitive environments. Instead, we are using electromyography (EMG) signals to predict human joint angles.
