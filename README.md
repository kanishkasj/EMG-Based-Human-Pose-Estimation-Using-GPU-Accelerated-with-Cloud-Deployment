# Real Time EMG Based Human Pose Estimation Using GPU Accelerated with Cloud Deployment
Human pose estimation is a technology used in rehabilitation, prosthetics. Traditional pose estimation relies heavily on camera-based systems, which face challenges such as privacy concerns, limited accuracy in low light and other environments conditions.
Electromyography (EMG) provides a alternative way by capturing signals generated by muscles during movement with respect to the pose/gestures. However, raw EMG signals are noisy, high-dimensional, and vary greatly between individuals. Real-time processing of EMG data for pose estimation requires efficient models, GPU acceleration for training and inference, and deployment through cloud platforms.

This project aims to design and implement a GPU-accelerated for EMG based human pose estimation and deploy the trained model on the cloud for real-time access. The follow is
1.	Cloud storage and train a model – preprocess the dataset and train a model and store the trained model for further validation
2.	Train XGBoost model with built in cuda GPU and Custom CUDA kernels – write our own cuda kernels for preprocessing and training XGBoost. 
3.	Deploy the model into Cloud – deploy the final model into AWS EC2 and expose it as a REST API endpoint, allowing users to send inputs remotely and receive respective output. 


## Project Overview
This project focuses on **real-time human pose estimation** using **Electromyography (EMG) signals**.  
We design and implement a **GPU-accelerated model** for predicting joint angles from EMG input, and deploy it to the **cloud** for real-time inference.

## Objectives
- Cloud and train a model: Preprocess EMG and joint-angle datasets (HDF5 + metadata).
- Implement **GPU-accelerated training**:
  - Baseline with **XGBoost (GPU hist)**.
  - Extend with **custom CUDA kernels** for preprocessing/training acceleration.
- Deploy the trained model as a **REST API** on cloud (AWS EC2).
- Demonstrate **real-time pose estimation** from EMG signals.

## System Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Input: HDF5 files (EMG + joint angles).
   - Apply band-pass filtering, rectification, smoothing, normalization.
   - Sliding-window segmentation for training samples.

2. **Model Training**
   - Baseline: XGBoost GPU (`tree_method=gpu_hist`).
   - Train per-joint regressors or multi-output model.
   - Optimize for **latency and accuracy**.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE per joint.
   - Compare baseline vs. CUDA-enhanced pipeline.

4. **Deployment**
   - Package trained models (`emg_pose_gpu.json`) into **FastAPI service**.
   - Deploy on **GPU-enabled EC2** instance.
   - Expose REST endpoint `/predict` for real-time inference.
