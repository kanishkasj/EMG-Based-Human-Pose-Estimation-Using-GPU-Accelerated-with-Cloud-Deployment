For this project, I am using the EMG2Pose Dataset provided by Facebook Research â€“ EMG2Pose (https://github.com/facebookresearch/emg2pose/tree/main)
Source: Downloaded directly from the official EMG2Pose GitHub repository.
Size: 600 MB.

Content:
Surface EMG signals collected from forearm muscles.
3D joint angle trajectories corresponding to hand/arm movements.
Synchronized timestamps to align EMG activity with joint kinematics.
Format: Data is stored in .hdf5 files, where each file contains multiple sessions of EMG recordings and corresponding pose information.

This dataset is designed for gesture recognition and EMG-to-pose estimation research, enabling the study of how muscle activity maps to human hand/arm movement.
